--------------------OUTPOST--------------------

-----GENRE: First-person shooter

-----GAME FLOW: The player spawns in a procedurally-generated area. A fair distance away from them is an outpost that's being guarded by enemy soldiers.

The player must assault the outpost, kill the enemy soldiers, and defend the outpost from enemy reinforcements.

Enemy reinforcements come in waves, and the player will have a limited amount of time to prepare before each wave approaches.

The player starts out with limited supplies on hand. Once the initial outpost guards are dead, the player can scavenge their equipment.

Killing enemies will reward the player with cash, that can be spent on additional weapons and items.

Bonus cash will be awarded for doing certain things, like killing enemies with headshots or surviving a wave without taking any damage.

-----PLUGINS REQUIRED:
	---EnhancedInput (enabled by default)
	---UINavigation 3.0
	---Procedural Content Generation Framework (experimental, only available in UE 5.2 and up)
	---Pro Aim Assist

---Some of the code and assets from the FPShooter project will be reused for this one
