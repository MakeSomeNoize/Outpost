---Create a base button class, derived from UINavComponent.

---Take a look at character meshes on Mixamo, and decide if any of them will be used for the project

---Finish building the weapon mechanics (firing, reloading, switching)

---Create OnTakePointDamage() callback functions in the player and enemy classes (once enemy class is created)

---Add "muzzle" sockets to each of the weapon meshes

---Create a health regeneration system for the player
	---When the player takes damage, RegenerateHealthHandle's timer is cleared and StartHealthRegenHandle's timer is set
	---StartHealthRegen() sets RegenerateHealthHandle's timer on a loop, according to HealthRegenRate
	---RegenerateHealth() increases the player's health, according to HealthRegenAmount

---Consider adding burst-fire functionality to OPWeapon class
	---Add BurstFireRate and bIsWeaponBurst variables to FWeaponStats struct
	---Add a protected BurstCount variable to class
	---If bIsWeaponBurst is true AND BurstCount is less than ShotAmount, then increment BurstCount and set a timer for Shoot() to be called again
	---In the weapon's firing montage, copy the firing animation multiple times; once for each shot in the burst
	---Once the burst-fire montage has ended, allow the player to fire again and reset BurstCount to 0 (do this inside an anim notify)

---Create UDamageType BP classes for each weapon

---TOO MANY OTHER THINGS TO LIST RIGHT NOW...
