---Search Google Fonts for a desirable font to use for this project

---Continue studying UI Material Lab example project
	---Start learning more about how to create materials, and material functions so I can make more sense of it all
	---Once I have a better understanding, migrate desired UI assets out of the project

---Create a health regeneration system for the player
	---When the player takes damage, RegenerateHealthHandle's timer is cleared and StartHealthRegenHandle's timer is set
	---StartHealthRegen() sets RegenerateHealthHandle's timer on a loop, according to HealthRegenRate
	---RegenerateHealth() increases the player's health, according to HealthRegenAmount

---Finish adding burst-fire functionality to OPWeapon class
	---If CurrentFireMode is EFireMode::Burst AND BurstCount is less than ShotAmount, then increment BurstCount
	---Set a timer for Shoot() to be called again, InRate will be BurstFireRate
	---Start an animation cooldown, InRate will be (WeaponFiringMontage * 3)
	---Once the burst-fire montage has ended, end the animation cooldown and reset BurstCount to 0
