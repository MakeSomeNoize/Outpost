This is a personal Blueprint Function Library, for storing helper functions that I've created for myself.
It is designed to be project-agnostic, so implementation should be as simple as adding it to a project in the IDE.

/* HOW TO USE THIS CLASS IN UNREAL PROJECTS:
1. Add the OZEFunctionLibrary.h and OZEFunctionLibrary.cpp files to the Unreal project's Source folder.

2. #include "OZEFunctionLibrary.h" in the desired class.

3. All functions in this Blueprint Function Library are static, so function calls must be prefixed with "UOZEFunctionLibrary::".
