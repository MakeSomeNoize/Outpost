﻿/*
This custom class replicates the functionality of the "Gate" node in Blueprint.
It is designed to be project-agnostic, so implementation should be as simple as adding it to a project in the IDE.
NOTE: The functions in this custom class can only be directly used in C++!

HOW TO USE THIS CLASS IN UNREAL PROJECTS:

1. Add the OZECustomGate.h file to the Unreal project's Source folder.

2. #include "OZECustomGate.h" in the desired class.

3. Declare a FGate struct as follows:

UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)
  	FGate Gate = FGate(false);

4. The bool parameter passed into the constructor determines whether the struct will start open, or start closed.

5. Use Gate.IsOpen() as a condition to check whether or not logic should be executed.

6. Call Gate.Open(), Gate.Close(), or Gate.Toggle() as needed.
